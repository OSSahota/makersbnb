#### Day 1 Retro ####

### What went well ###

- Active record set up - Was fun, interesting and much simpler than datamapper, offers an easier understanding of DB's
- User Stories - Was a long process but rewarding as it pushed our attention to detail and need to dissect specs. The process of conversion was one of small steps but taught us much. The successful creation of the user stories has made the project easier to understand and approach step by step.
- We had a good commit method - committing tests when they fail as well as when they pass.
- We followed a good TDD process, creating first feature tests before any code and allowed these to inform our programming.
- The process our team followed was good, focusing on modelling first and the use of trello was great for informing ands directing work flow. The two pairs and one float who researches/ jumps in where needed seemed to work well also.
- Git branching - was good practice of debugging methodologies.
- We had fun.

### What could have gone better or needs to change ###

- The retention and sharing of information - Process decided on is to spend time in the evening to share what we learned that day especially with things like Active Record and Git Branching. We may also use another M.D file to log and keep track of our learnings.

### Learnings ###

- How to effectively divide work amongst a team.
- Felt like learning how a project would be completed in the real world.
- I can grow collaboratively - Trello was a great tool and useful, Working off of one repo shows how we stick to processes well.
- We can Learn anything - We taught ourselves how to git branch and work off one repo. We taught ourselves to use ActiveRecord, we taught ourselves to not spill water.
