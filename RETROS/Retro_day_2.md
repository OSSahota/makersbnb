### Day 2 Retro ###

### What went well ###

- Focusing on the learning objective of the project
- Collecting good evidence for our Viva's
- Good progress made on project
- Good learnings about ActiveRecord and Databases and how to set it up correctly.
- Good Modelling design and structure - was really useful to have the class model as it helped direct the workflow really well.
- Making the list class - Had a smooth workflow, gave the pair greater confidence
- Gem awareness - The pitfalls of using gems
- Good pairing process from all pairs throughout Day
- Mobbing went well with Debugging and was exceptional for debugging and unblocking
- The float position continues to work well - the fresher eyes of the float have been invaluable for debugging.
- Jaques new feedback slack is a great idea
- Mobbing - from one driver was seen as really good when mobbing on activerecord, from the other was seen as harder due to deciding who to listen to.


### what could have gone better or needs to change ###

- Debugging - pairs are to spend no more than 15 mins problem solving and then grab the float or other pair depending on need. Suggest process is float first then pull in second pair to decrease chance of workflow obstruction.
- Communicate when we have problems faster
- Gems!!!!
- Focus on functionality only, and put time into design when needed.
- Set a goal as a team in morning and work to that goal. Suggest setting a coding goal and a learning goal.

### Learnings ###

- Databases - better understanding of Rake, what it does and how to use it through command line.
- How to implement a layout.erb and how it works within the program.
- That tables should only be created by migration not manually from the command line
- Follow a RED - COMMIT - GREEN -COMMIT - REFACTOR - COMMIT process to show both a strong TDD approach, and a strong refactoring method.
